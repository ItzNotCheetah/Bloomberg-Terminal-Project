# Bloomberg-Terminal-Project 📈📰

This project is a lightweight, automated “Bloomberg Terminal” for monitoring stock movements and related news — built entirely in Python. While full Bloomberg Terminals are expensive and feature-rich, this script demonstrates the core functionality of tracking stock prices and delivering actionable news:

- 📊 Monitors daily stock prices for any company (default: Tesla Inc / TSLA).  
- 🔺 Calculates daily percentage changes in stock price.  
- 📰 Fetches the top 3 relevant news articles if the stock moves more than 5%, providing real-time context for market changes.  
- 📱 Sends the news and stock movement alerts directly to your WhatsApp via Twilio.  

Essentially, this project combines market data and news aggregation, delivering instant insights just like a Bloomberg Terminal — but in a simple, free, and customizable Python script.
